**Note: Multiple legal actions are pending against the board at this time by one member. We will be addressing both a small claims filing against the board, and a show-cause hearing pending, at this meeting. 



Regarding the show-cause hearing: The board received records requests on Jan. 28, 2018 for various reports, board member emails, and the addresses of all individual MNA members. We replied that we are working with SE Uplift and the City of Portlandâ€™s Office of Neighborhood Involvement to respond to the request in a reasonable time, identifying all applicable records that we are required to turn over, and with a reasonable cost to produce the records. 



The board takes the release of all personal members' information seriously and have had many members express concern that their personal information might be shared. We have been seeking a way to both respond to the records request and protect those members who do not want their information shared to anyone in the neighborhood who attends one meeting. We discussed this matter at length at our board meeting on Jan. 12th as part of our discussion on how to move forward to address the records requests.



After 5 days, the member making the request felt the response was inadequate and filed in Multnomah County Court for a hearing to compel the release of the records by court order. Since no board members are attorneys, we have explored options for legal counsel, leading to this meeting. The court date set for Thursday requires us to address this issue through emergency meeting. 



The ONI standards allow neighborhood associations to hold executive sessions that are closed to the public for a number of reasons, one of which is to consult with legal counsel (Section VIII, D.2.c.).

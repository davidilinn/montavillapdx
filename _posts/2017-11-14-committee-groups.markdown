Hello, I got the committee addresses working. You can email the committees themselves at these addresses. All of the committee chairs should be setup in the groups.

The groups are:

* Outreach & Comms: outreach@montavillapdx.org
* Housing & Homelessness: housing-homelessness@montavillapdx.org
* Land Use & Transportation: land-use@montavillapdx.org
* Public Safety: safety@montavillapdx.org
